Face-detection model using Viola-Jones Algortihm

# Prerequisite
 Python3 
 openCV
 
 # About
 
 This is an face detection model which uses Viola-Jones Algorithm to detect the faces.
 
 Different factors are used here: Scale-Fcator,
                                  Min-Neighbour,
                                  Min-Size
 # Features
 
 Face-detection.py: Detect the faces in the image that is being feed to the algorithm
 
 
 
 Face-detection(Real Time).py: Tries to Detect the face in the Video camera feed 
 
 
# Update
* **New SKetching of the image and webcamera feed is added**
